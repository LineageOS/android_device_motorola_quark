      "message": "The current problem with the other commit is that it requires change in the HAL which isn\u0027t there.\n\nThe issue are the actual values passed to kernel driver, at the moment those are:\nhttps://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_kernel_motorola_apq8084/blob/cm-12.1/include/sound/pcm.h#L123, while the patch would want the actual Hz instead.\n\nSo until the HAL isn\u0027t patched, we need to revert back in the kernel, but since there is a bunch of sampling rates not supported originally, then we just use the \"correct\" ones, and \"drop support\" of them in the kernel, since most of the unsupported ones are not used anyway.",
