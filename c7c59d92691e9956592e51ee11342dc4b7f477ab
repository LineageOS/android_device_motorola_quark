      "message": "Personally, I would just leave these as ActionableSensors because it doesn\u0027t seem like this layer of code should really care what the sensors are actually sensing.\n\nIf you need to have the setScreenOn (below) then maybe it would make more sense to keep these all as ActionableSensor and then replace .enable and .disable with .setScreenOn and .setScreenOff which would let you keep the generic interface and support how you want to use the ir gesture sensor.",
